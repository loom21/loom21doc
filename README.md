#### Services Management

> :bell: Services are managed in a similar way to products. You can create, edit, and categorize services just like products. However, services differ in that they are not included in inventory calculations, as they don't affect stock levels or require physical tracking.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Inventory <a id="inventory"></a>
On this page, you can view and update the inventory of products across different stores. The inventory is automatically calculated based on sales and deliveries, ensuring accurate stock levels. You can manually adjust inventory if needed, giving you full control over product availability per location.

#### Suppliers Management

Suppliers are managed similarly to customers, with the same ability to search, import, create, and edit their information. However, the key distinction is in their usage:

- Suppliers are selected during Deliveries Management.
- Customers are selected during Sales Management.

This ensures that suppliers are linked to product supply, while customers are tied to sales transactions.
